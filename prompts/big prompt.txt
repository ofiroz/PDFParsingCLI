</SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION>

<TASK>
Analyze the provided CV text for readability metrics, complex sentences, passive voice, jargon, and provide improvement suggestions. Format your response according to the specified structure.
</TASK>

<CONTEXT>
The CV text has been extracted from a PDF document. Your analysis should focus on making the CV more readable, clear, and effective by identifying issues and suggesting improvements.
</CONTEXT>


<ANALYSIS_REQUIREMENTS>
1. Perform readability analysis:
   - Calculate Flesch Reading Ease score (0-100 scale)
   - Calculate Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level
   - Identify all sentences exceeding 20 words as complex

2. Detect linguistic issues:
   - Identify all instances of passive voice
   - Flag sentences containing potential industry jargon or overly technical language

3. Provide improvement suggestions:
   - Suggest specific rewrites for complex sentences (>20 words)
   - Provide active voice alternatives for passive voice constructions
   - Offer simplified versions of jargon-heavy phrases

4. Generate a comprehensive analysis report with all findings and suggestions
</ANALYSIS_REQUIREMENTS>

<OUTPUT_FORMAT>
Provide your response in the following structured format:

<READABILITY_SCORES>
- Flesch Reading Ease: [SCORE]/100 ([INTERPRETATION]: e.g., "Fairly easy to read" or "College level")
- Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level: [GRADE]
- Overall Assessment: [BRIEF_ASSESSMENT]
</READABILITY_SCORES>

<COMPLEX_SENTENCES>
[List each sentence exceeding 20 words with line number or section reference]
1. "[SENTENCE]" (Word count: [COUNT], Location: [SECTION])
2. ...
</COMPLEX_SENTENCES>

<PASSIVE_VOICE>
[List each instance of passive voice with line number or section reference]
1. "[PASSIVE_CONSTRUCTION]" (Location: [SECTION])
   - Suggested active alternative: "[ACTIVE_ALTERNATIVE]"
</PASSIVE_VOICE>

<JARGON_DETECTION>
[List potential jargon or overly technical terms/phrases]
1. "[JARGON_TERM/PHRASE]" (Location: [SECTION])
   - Simplified alternative: "[SIMPLIFIED_VERSION]"
</JARGON_DETECTION>

<IMPROVEMENT_SUGGESTIONS>
[Provide specific, actionable improvement suggestions for each issue category]

1. Complex Sentences:
   - Original: "[ORIGINAL_COMPLEX_SENTENCE]"
   - Suggested rewrite: "[SIMPLIFIED_VERSION]"

2. Passive Voice:
   - Original: "[ORIGINAL_PASSIVE_SENTENCE]"
   - Suggested rewrite: "[ACTIVE_VERSION]"

3. Jargon:
   - Original: "[ORIGINAL_JARGON_HEAVY_PHRASE]"

  1. [ISSUE_1]
  2. [ISSUE_2]
  3. [ISSUE_3]
- Overall readability improvement potential: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
</SUMMARY>

<CODE_IMPLEMENTATION>
Provide a Python code implementation that performs this analysis. The code should:
1. Extract text from PDF (using PyPDF2 or pdfplumber)
2. Calculate readability metrics
3. Detect complex sentences, passive voice, and jargon
4. Generate improvement suggestions
5. Display results in a structured CLI output
6. Follow PEP 8 standards and include appropriate comments

The code should be complete, efficient, and handle both single and multi-column CVs.
