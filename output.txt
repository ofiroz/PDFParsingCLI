<READABILITY_SCORES>
- Flesch Reading Ease: 31.2/100
- Interpretation: Very difficult to read.
- Overall readability assessment: The CV is difficult to read, requiring a college graduate level of understanding. This is mainly due to complex sentences and jargon.
</READABILITY_SCORES>

<READABILITY_PATTERNS>
[List patterns that affect readability, excluding sentence complexity]
1. Extensive use of technical jargon: The CV is filled with technical terms and acronyms (e.g., microservices, cloud-native, CI/CD, AWS, Kubernetes, Elasticsearch). While necessary to convey skills, it creates a barrier for non-technical readers.
2. Dense information blocks: The Technical Proficiencies and Professional Experience sections present a lot of information in a compact space, making it visually overwhelming.
3. Formatting inconsistencies: Minor formatting issues (e.g., spacing in "San F rancisco") can distract from the content.
4. Use of numbers and percentages: While helpful, excessive use of percentages (e.g., "40% improvement," "60% reduction") can be overwhelming if not presented with clear context.
