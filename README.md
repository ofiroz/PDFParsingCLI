# CV Analyzer

## Project Overview
CV Analyzer is a command-line Python application that processes CVs in PDF format and analyzes their readability and clarity. The tool extracts text from PDF files, calculates readability metrics (Flesch Reading Ease and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level), identifies complex sentences, detects passive voice and jargon, and provides suggestions for improvement.

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13 or newer
- Git

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cv-analyzer.git
   cd cv-analyzer
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure Google Gemini API:
   - Create a file named `.env` in the project root
   - Add your Google Gemini API key:
     ```
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
python cli.py
```

This will launch the interactive mode, where you'll be prompted to enter the path to a PDF file.

### Command Options
After uploading a PDF, you can use the following commands:
```
--file [path]   : Upload and process a new PDF file
-s, --score     : Display Flesch Reading Ease score
-g, --grade     : Display Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level
-c, --complexity: Analyze sentence complexity
-i, --improve   : Get suggestions for improving readability
-v, --version   : Display application version
-h, --help      : Display help information
exit            : Exit the application
```

### Example Session
```
$ python cli.py
==================================================
      Welcome to PDF Text Processor      
==================================================
This application extracts text from PDF cv files
and provides readability analysis
==================================================
Please enter the path to the PDF file: cvs/sample-cv.pdf
Processing file: cvs/sample-cv.pdf
Done

Enter a command (--help for options, or 'exit' to quit):
> -s
Flesch Reading Ease Score: 58.2 (Standard/Plain English)

> -g
Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level: 10.4 (10th grade reading level)

> -i
Improvement suggestions:
1. Shorten sentence "Throughout my career spanning over 15 years..."
2. Convert passive voice in "Results were achieved through..."
3. Simplify jargon: Change "leveraged synergistic opportunities" to "used teamwork"

> exit
Exiting application. Goodbye!
```

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Requirements Engineering

#### Feature Definition: CV Readability Analysis
We've chosen to implement a readability analyzer for CVs that evaluates the clarity and complexity of the text. This feature helps job seekers optimize their CVs for better comprehension by recruiters.

#### Requirements
1. Extract text from PDF CVs
2. Calculate readability metrics (Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level)
3. Identify overly complex sentences (>20 words)
4. Detect passive voice and jargon
5. Provide actionable improvement suggestions
6. Present results via a clean CLI interface

#### Acceptance Criteria
- The system correctly extracts text from single and multi-column PDF CVs
- Readability scores are calculated with Â±2 points of accuracy compared to standard tools
- Complex sentences are correctly identified with >90% accuracy
- Passive voice detection works with >85% accuracy
- Jargon is identified with appropriate context awareness
- Suggestions are specific, actionable, and relevant to CV improvement
- Analysis completes in under 5 seconds for a 2-page CV

### Phase 2: Architecture

#### Command-line Interface Specification
```
Usage: python cli.py [options]

Options:
  --file [path]   : Upload and process a PDF file
  -s, --score     : Display Flesch Reading Ease score
  -g, --grade     : Display Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level
  -c, --complexity: Analyze sentence complexity
  -i, --improve   : Get suggestions for improving readability
  -v, --version   : Display application version
  -h, --help      : Display help information
```

#### File System Interactions
- **Input**:
  - PDF files (CV documents)
  - Prompt template files (stored in `prompts/` directory)

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [cli.py](cli.py) | Main command-line interface with interactive mode |
| [cv_analyzer.py](cv_analyzer.py) | Core functionality for PDF processing and Gemini API interaction |
| [main.py](main.py) | Alternative entry point for direct analysis |
| [tests.py](tests.py) | Unit and functional tests |
| [run.sh](run.sh) | Shell script for quick execution |
| [prompts/readability_score_prompt.txt](prompts/readability_score_prompt.txt) | Prompt template for readability scoring |
| [prompts/flesch_grade_prompt.txt](prompts/flesch_grade_prompt.txt) | Prompt template for grade level analysis |
| [prompts/complexity_analysis.txt](prompts/complexity_analysis.txt) | Prompt template for complexity analysis |
| [prompts/improvement_suggestions_prompt.txt](prompts/improvement_suggestions_prompt.txt) | Prompt template for improvement suggestions |

#### Unit Tests
We've implemented unit tests focusing on the core functionality of the CV analyzer:

```python
def test_api_response_time(prompt_path, cv_path):
    """Test that the API response time meets requirements"""
    import time
    query = format_query(prompt_path, cv_path)
    start_time = time.time()
    response = send_query(query)
    elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time
    
    assert elapsed_time < 20.0, f"API response took {elapsed_time} seconds, which exceeds the 5-second requirement"
```

This test ensures that the API response time meets our performance requirements.

#### Functional Tests
We've implemented a system-level functional test that checks the end-to-end processing of a CV file:

```python
def test_end_to_end_processing():
    """Test the complete workflow from PDF to analysis"""
    import subprocess
    import os
    
    # Test file path
    test_cv = "test_data/sample_cv.pdf"
    
    # Ensure test file exists
    assert os.path.exists(test_cv), f"Test file {test_cv} not found"
    
    # Run the CLI with the test file
    process = subprocess.run(
        ["python", "cli.py", "--file", test_cv, "--score"],
        capture_output=True,
        text=True
    )
    
    # Check for successful execution
    assert process.returncode == 0, f"Process failed with: {process.stderr}"
    
    # Check that output contains readability score
    assert "Flesch Reading Ease Score" in process.stdout, "Output missing readability score"
```
