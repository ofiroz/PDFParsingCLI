prompt:
how should we implement XP in our code?
and how we did do that up untill now?

Your code shows several XP principles in action:

Simple Design: Your codebase is straightforward, focused on the specific feature of readability analysis. Classes like PDFProcessor handle specific responsibilities without unnecessary complexity.
Continuous Testing: You've implemented test functions in tests.py to verify API response times, showing the commitment to testing as development proceeds.
Small Releases: Your application is structured to provide incremental functionality through command-line options (--score, --grade, --improve), allowing for iterative improvement.
Refactoring: There's evidence of refactoring in your code, such as commented-out functions (like extract_text_from_pdf) that were likely replaced with better implementations.
Pair Programming: While I can't directly observe this, the clear division of responsibilities in the code suggests collaborative work.
Collective Ownership: The modular design allows different team members to work on different components (CLI, CV analysis, etc.) while maintaining a cohesive codebase.
Continuous Integration: The structure of your project suggests components are designed to be integrated smoothly, with clear interfaces between modules.
